# `iclip`

Interclip for your terminal!

## Instalation

Assuming you have Go installed on your system, this is very easy. Just go to your terminal, and execute the command below. This will install the version on the `main` branch.

```bash
go install github.com/interclip/iclip@latest
```

If you don't have Go installed or want to use a specific version, you can grab a binary for your system at the [releases page](https://github.com/interclip/iclip/releases)
